# About Spokane DSA

<!-- [Image placeholder: Spokane DSA chapter members] -->

We are your neighbors, coworkers, and friends in Spokane who believe everyone deserves a fair chance at a good life. The Spokane chapter of Democratic Socialists of America brings together regular people who want to make our community and country work better for everyone.

## What is Democratic Socialism?

Democratic socialism means giving regular people more say in the decisions that affect their lives. It's simple:

- **Democracy in government**: Your voice should matter as much as rich people's money
- **Democracy at work**: Workers should have a say in how their workplace runs
- **Meeting everyone's needs**: Healthcare, housing, and education should be available to all, not just those who can pay

We believe the economy should work for everyone, not just make profits for a few wealthy people at the top.

## What We Do in Spokane

<!-- [Image placeholder: Community action or meeting] -->

Our chapter works on issues that matter to people in our community:

### Workers' Rights
We stand with workers fighting for better pay, safer conditions, and the right to organize unions. When workers organize, they win better lives for their families.

### Housing Justice
Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to live. We fight against unfair rent increases and work for more affordable housing in Spokane.

### Healthcare for All
We believe nobody should go broke or die because they can't afford to see a doctor. We fight for a healthcare system that covers everyone.

### Climate Action
We want clean air and water for our kids and a healthy planet for the future. We support plans like the Green New Deal that create good jobs while protecting the environment.

### Community Support
We help organize mutual aid programs where neighbors help each other, especially during tough times.

## Our Chapter

The Spokane DSA chapter meets on the first Tuesday of every month from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM, with a social activity afterwards at a local pub or restaurant. We welcome everyone who wants to make Spokane a better place.

At our meetings, we:
- Plan campaigns and actions
- Learn about issues facing our community
- Make decisions together democratically
- Build friendships and support networks

## Part of a National Movement

Spokane DSA is part of the [Democratic Socialists of America](https://dsausa.org), which has over 90,000 members across the United States. We're the largest organization working for democratic socialism in America.

Together with chapters from Seattle to New York to Los Angeles, we're building a movement powerful enough to win real change.

## Our History

The fight for justice and fairness has deep roots in America. Leaders like Eugene V. Debs, who fought for workers' rights, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who fought for civil rights and economic justice, carried this vision forward.

Today's Democratic Socialists continue this proud tradition. In Spokane, we're building on this history while focusing on the issues that matter most to our community right now.

# About Spokane DSA

The Spokane chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America is part of a nationwide organization working to build a more just and equitable society.

## What is Democratic Socialism?

Democratic socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few. We are committed to democracy as not only a political system but as a way of life that should extend to all aspects of society.

## Our Mission

We organize locally to:

- Fight for economic justice and workers' rights
- Advocate for universal healthcare and housing as human rights
- Combat climate change through a Green New Deal
- Build solidarity among working people
- Create democratic control over our economy and government

## Our Chapter

The Spokane DSA chapter brings together activists, community members, and organizers who share a commitment to democratic socialism. We meet regularly, organize campaigns, participate in direct action, and work to build a better future for everyone in our community.

## National Organization

Spokane DSA is part of the national [Democratic Socialists of America](https://dsausa.org), the largest socialist organization in the United States with over 90,000 members nationwide.

## History

Democratic socialism has deep roots in American politics, from Eugene V. Debs to Martin Luther King Jr. Today's DSA continues this tradition of fighting for justice and equality.

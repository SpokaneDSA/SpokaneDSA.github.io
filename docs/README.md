## Welcome to Spokane DSA

<!-- [Image placeholder: Photo of Spokane DSA members at a community event] -->

We are your neighbors in Spokane who believe everyone deserves a good life. We work together to make our community and our country work for all people, not just the wealthy few.

### What We Do

**Meet Together**: We meet on the first Tuesday of every month from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM, with a social activity afterwards at a local pub or restaurant. Everyone is welcome to join us online or in person to plan actions and learn together.

**Take Action**: We support workers fighting for better pay, help people find affordable housing, and fight for healthcare that everyone can afford.

**Help Our Community**: We organize events, support local causes, and connect with other groups working to make Spokane better.

**Learn Together**: We share ideas about how to make our economy and government work for everyone, not just the rich.

### Why We Organize

We believe that regular people—workers, students, neighbors—should have power over decisions that affect our lives. That means:

- **Good Jobs**: Everyone deserves fair pay, safe working conditions, and the right to form unions
- **Homes for All**: Housing is a basic need, not a way to make profit
- **Healthcare for Everyone**: Nobody should go broke or die because they can't afford a doctor
- **A Healthy Planet**: We need clean air, clean water, and action on climate change
- **Real Democracy**: Our government should listen to regular people, not just big corporations

We're part of the Democratic Socialists of America, the largest group working for these goals in the United States. Together with over 90,000 members across the country, we're building a movement for real change.
